        port        => 14000,
        username    => 'jdoe',

# DESCRIPTION

This module is a quick and dirty hack to add Kerberos support to Satoshi
Tagomori's module [Net::Hadoop::WebHDFS](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Hadoop::WebHDFS), to access Hadoop secure clusters. It
simply subclasses the original module, replacing [Furl](https://metacpan.org/pod/Furl) with [LWP](https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP), which
will transparently use [LWP::Authen::Negotiate](https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::Authen::Negotiate) when needed. So the real
documentation is contained in [Net::Hadoop::WebHDFS](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Hadoop::WebHDFS).

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

As mentioned above, the real work was done by Satoshi Tagomori

Thanks to my employer Booking.com to allow me to release this module for public use
