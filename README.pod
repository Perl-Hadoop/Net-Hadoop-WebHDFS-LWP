=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Hadoop::WebHDFS::LWP;
    
    my $client = Net::Hadoop::WebHDFS::LWP->new(
        host        => 'webhdfs.local',
        port        => 14000,
        username    => 'jdoe',

    ) or die "Could not write to HDFS";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a quick and dirty hack to add Kerberos support to Satoshi
Tagomori's module L<Net::Hadoop::WebHDFS>, to access Hadoop secure clusters. It
simply subclasses the original module, substituting LWP to Furl, which
transparently use LWP::Auth::Negotiate when needed. The real documentation is 
contained in Net::Hadoop::WebHDFS

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

As mentioned above, the real work was done by Satoshi Tagomori

Thanks to my employer Booking.com to allow me to release this module for public use
